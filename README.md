# MAL2
Project: Find out the reason why the MAL2 Cogen engine will have power fluctuations. 



Issue: A portion of the raw data is unwanted. For instance, when the engine is restarting, or off for maintenance. 



Solution: 



1. Write Python script to filter out unwanted data.

2. Visualise the filtered data and plot graphs.

3. Analyse the graph to find the correlation between engine power fluctuations and work being done on the engine.
